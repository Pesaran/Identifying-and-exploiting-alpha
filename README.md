This replication package includes files necessary for reproducing results, tables, and figures in Pesaran and Smith (2024)  https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02217 using MATLAB and R1. It consists of three sub-folders, each described below: 

Current Version: April 30, 2024
Folder: Replications – Main Paper
This folder contains the replication files for the empirical examples discussed in the main paper. Inside, you will find two subfolders: "Table 1, Table 2, Table 3" and "Table 4, Figure 1." Each subfolder contains the replication codes necessary to reproduce the Tables and Figures specified in their names. You can download a zip file from here.

Folder: Replications – Online Supplement A
This folder contains the results and replication files to produce the tables and figures in Online Supplement A: Data Sources and Calibration of Monte Carlo Designs. Inside, you will find three subfolders: "Table 1-5, 7, Figure 1-5", "Table 6", "Table 8." Each subfolder contains the replication codes necessary to reproduce the Tables and Figures specified in their names. You can download a zip file from here.

Folder: Replications – MC Online Supplement B
This folder contains all required files for replicating the Monte Carlo simulations described in MC Online Supplement B. It contains twenty-four subfolders, each linked to a specific table or figure in the supplement. You will find the corresponding results and the replication codes needed to recreate the tables and figures identified by the subfolder names inside each subfolder. You can download a zip file from here.

Each of these folders contains its own ReadMe files describing the steps to generate the corresponding Tables and Figures.
