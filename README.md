# Identifying-and-exploiting-alpha
The codes and data relates to Pesaran and Smith (2024), Identifying and exploiting alpha in linear asset pricing models with strong, semi-strong, and latent factors.
This replication package includes files necessary for reproducing results, tables, and figures in Pesaran and Smith (2024) using MATLAB and R.  It consists of three sub-folders, each described below:

Current Version: April 30, 2024

1. Folder: Replications – Main Paper

This folder contains the replication files for the empirical examples discussed in the main paper. Inside, you will find two subfolders: “Table 1, Table 2, Table 3” and “Table 4, Figure 1.” Each subfolder contains the replication codes necessary to reproduce the Tables and Figures specified in their names.

2. Folder: Replications – Online Supplement A

This folder contains the results and replication files to produce the tables and figures in Online Supplement A: Data Sources and Calibration of Monte Carlo Designs. Inside, you will find three subfolders: “Table 1-5, 7, Figure 1-5”, “Table 6”, “Table 8.” Each subfolder contains the replication codes necessary to reproduce the Tables and Figures specified in their names.

3. Folder: Replications – MC Online Supplement B

This folder contains all required files for replicating the Monte Carlo simulations described in MC Online Supplement B. It contains twenty-four subfolders, each linked to a specific table or figure in the supplement. You will find the corresponding results and the replication codes needed to recreate the tables and figures identified by the subfolder names inside each subfolder.
Each of these folders contains its own ReadMe files describing the steps to generate the corresponding Tables and Figures.
